# The ideal programming class (Prof's recs)
+ content, i.e. Linux, GitHub, Python, programming logic (practicality)
+ structure, i.e. pace, order, grading, rules, exams, deadlines
+ delivery, i.e. lecture, video, TA, coderie, assignments, interaction

# The ideal programming class (discussion)

## Content
+ spend more time integrating CLI interaction/more constant
  throughout course, e.g. creating test files
+ content felt relevant and useful/practical
+ more time on loops
+ good coding habits, e.g. proofreading, optimization (RAM), spacing,
  naming vars, naming/using functions, debugging, pre-programming approach

## Structure
+ pace is good > self-paced
+ no-stakes exam was nice for practice, learning > more like it
+ no-stakes easy (pop) quizzes with varying levels based on pace
+ good soft deadlines

## Delivery
+ example programs for reference
+ group delivery > tutorials and short program work in-class (PHY7-style?),
  supervised by prof
+ mix of group and indiv work > groups in class, indiv hw
+ groups based on goals
+ in-class time to work on hw?
+ groups based on mix of experience (measured by pace) > allows student teaching,
  helps with catchup without teaching new stuff that loses people
