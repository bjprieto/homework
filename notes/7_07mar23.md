# To-do
+ revise 50dust to be faster, clearer
+ attempt 62 and 63, with help if needed
+ get started on unit7 hw

# JSON
+ JavaScript Object Notation
+ no comments
+ common complex data structure format
+ similar to python data structures, `[]` and `{}` formatting
+ all double quotes, no single quotes
+ actually doesn't require tabbing
+ will work without whitespace since only defined by `[]`, `{}`, `,`, `""`

# Complex Data Structures
+ 2D arrays, e.g. list of lists
+ index values with corresponding coords, e.g. `array[1st_coord][2nd_coord]`
+ spreadsheets: first list/row = column name, subsequent lists are row values
+ records: dictionaries with fields and values per instance
+ most information stored in our minds are in more than 2 dimensions
+ more than 2 dimensions are hard to understand digitally
+ even if data has higher dimensionality, usually they are stored in 2D
  structures for better readability, although still difficult to read

# 62
+ don't forget about string methods, e.g. .split()
