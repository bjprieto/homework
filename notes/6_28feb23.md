# Unit 6

## Dictionaries (60)
+ iterating over keys returns keys
+ iterating over items returns key:value pairs as a tuple
+ better to iterate over key, value since they're stored as tuples
+ assigning a value to a key either overwrites an existing key with the same
  name or creates a new one
+ allows accounting for unexpected sequence identities to be counted
+ faster than a linear search due to using a checksum method

## Regular expressions (61)
+ allows quick searching in an iterable, e.g. string, list, dictionary, tuple
+ allows 'capturing' of a desired string, etc. from a larger iterable

## Timer (62)
