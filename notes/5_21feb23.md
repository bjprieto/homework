# Not copying files
+ try not to copy files to avoid having only one edited copy when you make
  changes
+ instead alias them with links so that there's only one copy, but present
  in all the directories that you want them in technically
+ aliases/links allow the files to exist in multiple places, which can be moved
  and deleted without destroying the orignal copy

# Misc.
+ . = this directory
+ .. = prev. directory

# Interpret programs
+ interpreter directive = '#!/(location of interpreter) (name of interpreter)'

```
#!/user/bin/env python3
```

# File permissions
+ i.e. read, write, execute (rwx)
+ user, group, public permissions

+ octal format: user, group, public permissions code
+ 4 = read, 2 = write, 1 = execute
+ use with chmod to change file permissions

+ handle file transfers carefully; file permission can change between OS's
